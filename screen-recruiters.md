Here are ideas on how to screen recruiters:
1. Is this your direct client? Have you worked with them before, do you have an MSA with them?
1. I would ask about their personal history with their firm. Have they worked there for 2 months or for a few years?
1. Can you tell me about your history of placing Salesforce resources?
