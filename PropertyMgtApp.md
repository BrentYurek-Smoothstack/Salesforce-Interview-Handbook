# Overview
PMA is a cloud-based property management solution that enables managers of residential properties to take control of every aspect of their business, including rent, vacancy, maintenance cycles and accounting.

PMA streamlines the rent cycle with features like tenant and lease tracking, full general ledger accounting, automated rent and fee reminders and on-demand reports. Additionally, rent collection can be automated; and property managers can receive online payments via Stripe integration. 

When applicants fill out Buildium’s online rental applications, the information is saved instantly to the Buildium tenant database. Buildium also offers tenant screening services for background checks. 

Tenants and rental owners can submit requests online via respective portals. Property managers can turnrequests into work items and assign them to maintenance managers and staff using desktop or mobile apps. 

Buildium recently added new features such as a Resident Center website & mobile app; Renter’s Insurance offerings for residents; and an updated lease renewals process.
